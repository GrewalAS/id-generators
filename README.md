# id-generators
 
### What?
A collection of classes that allow for generating unique IDs using two different algorithms:
- [Twitter's Snowflake][1]
- [Flickr's Ticket][2]

### Why?
Mostly for fun. I also wanted to learn about IDs that aren't UUIDs, are somewhat semi-sortable by time and are unique.
